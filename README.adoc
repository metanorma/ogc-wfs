OGC Web Feature Service in Metanorma

Based on the Asciidoctor markup in https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES

Note that the original markup has mostly been left alone, with the exception of
the prefatory material, much of which has been treated as automatically generated
boilerplate, or as document attributes. The autonumbering counters of the
document have been kept, but they are not used in Metanorma, which implements
its own autonumbering, and can be left out of Metanorma Asciidoctor.

Unlike Native Asciidoctor, if no text is provided for a cross-reference, the
cross-reference text will be provided automatically as a clause/asset number,
not as the clause/asset title; e.g. "Clause 7.5.1", not "HTTP status codes".

Recommendations, Requirements and Permissions are recognised automatically,
as tables whose first cell is "Recommendation", "Requirement" or "Permission",
optionally followed by a number -- as has been done in the source WFS_FES document.

Some additional references have been added to the text. Some additional
cross-references have been added within Annex A, but this has not been done
exhaustively; the references to recommendations etc. within Annex A have not
been marked up as cross-references.

The generated HTML, PDF and DOC from the Metanorma Asciidoctor source has been
included in the repository. To compile:

[source,console]
----
cd core/standard
sh make.sh
----

Note that while command-line `asciidoctor` permits includes outside of the
directory the document is in (e.g. `include::../../openapi.yaml[]`), in
asciidoctor embedded within Ruby (as is the case in Metanorma), such includes
are blocked as unsafe. 
http://discuss.asciidoctor.org/Newbie-question-Can-snippet-contents-be-retained-after-snippets-deleted-td4018.html
documents a workaround to permit it programmatically, but we have preferred to move all the
included files within the `core/standard` directory.

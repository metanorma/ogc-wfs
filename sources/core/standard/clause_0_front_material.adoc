Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of any relevant patent claims or other intellectual property rights of which they may be aware that might be infringed by any implementation of the standard set forth in this document, and to provide supporting documentation.

*ISO Declaration*

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

== Abstract

A Web Feature Service (WFS) offers the capability to create, modify and query spatial data on the Web. The WFS standard is a multi-part document. This part specifies the core capabilities that every WFS has to support and is restricted to read-access to spatial data. Additional capabilities that address specific needs will be specified in additional parts. Examples include support for creating and modifying data, more complex data models, richer queries, and additional coordinate reference systems.

By default, every WFS instance provides access to a single dataset. Rather than sharing the data as a complete dataset, WFS offers direct, fine-grained access to the data at the feature (object) level.

Consistent with the architecture of the Web, this version of the WFS standard uses a resource architecture and specifies a RESTful service interface consistent with the IETF HTTP/HTTPS RFCs.

This standard specifies discovery and query operations that are implemented using the HTTP GET method. Support for additional methods (in particular POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) will be specified in additional parts.

Discovery operations allow the server to be interrogated to determine its capabilities and retrieve information (metadata) about this distribution of the dataset. This includes the API definition of the server as well as metadata about the feature collections provided by the server.

Query operations allow features or values of feature properties to be retrieved from the underlying data store based upon selection criteria, defined by the client, on feature properties.

This standard defines the resources listed in <<tldnr>>. For an overview of the resources, see section <<core-overview,7.1 Overview>>.

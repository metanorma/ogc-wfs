== Conformance
This standard defines six requirements / conformance classes.

The standardization targets of all conformance classes are "web services".

The main requirements class is:

* <<rc_core,Core>>.

The _Core_ specifies requirements that all WFS have to implement.

The _Core_ does not mandate a specific encoding or format for representing features or
feature collections. Four requirements classes depend on the _Core_
and specify representations for these resources in commonly used encodings
for spatial data on the web:

* <<rc_html,HTML>>,
* <<rc_geojson,GeoJSON>>,
* <<rc_gmlsf0,Geography Markup Language (GML), Simple Features Profile, Level 0>>, and
* <<rc_gmlsf2,Geography Markup Language (GML), Simple Features Profile, Level 2>>.

None of these encodings are mandatory and an implementation of the _Core_
may also decide to implement none of them, but to implement another encoding instead.

That said, the _Core_ requirements class includes recommendations to support
where practical <<rec_html,HTML>> and <<rec_geojson,GeoJSON>> as encodings.
<<overview,Clause 6 (Overview)>> includes a discussion about the recommended
encodings.

The _Core_ does not mandate any encoding or format for the formal definition of
the API either. One option is the OpenAPI 3.0 specification and a requirements
class has been specified for OpenAPI 3.0, which depends on the _Core_:

* <<rc_oas30,OpenAPI specification 3.0>>.

Like with the feature encodings, an implementation of the _Core_ requirements
class may also decide to use other API definition representations in
addition or instead of an OpenAPI 3.0 definition. Examples for alternative
API definitions: OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger), future versions of the OpenAPI
specification, an OWS Common 2.0 capabilities document or WSDL.

The _Core_ is intended to be the minimal useful service interface for fine-grained
access to a spatial dataset.

Additional capabilities such as support for transactions, complex data
structures, rich queries, other coordinate reference systems,
subscription/notification, returning aggregated results, etc., may be
specified in future parts of WFS or as vendor-specific extensions.

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests
specified in <<annex-a>> (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and
methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance
are specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the
OGC Compliance Testing web site.

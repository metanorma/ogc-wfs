If a property `numberMatched` is included in the response, the value SHALL
be identical to the number of features in the feature collections that match
the selection parameters like `bbox`, `time` or additional filter parameters.

A server MAY omit this information in a response, if the information about the
number of matching features is not known or difficult to compute.

For each feature collection, the `extent` property, if provided, SHALL be a bounding box that includes all spatial and temporal geometries in this collection.

If a feature has multiple properties with spatial or temporal information, it is the decision of the server whether only a single spatial or temporal geometry property is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.

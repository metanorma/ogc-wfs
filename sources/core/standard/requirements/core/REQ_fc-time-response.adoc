Only features that have a temporal geometry that intersects the timestamp or
time period SHALL be part of the result set, if the `time` parameter is provided.

The temporal information is either a date-time or a period string that
adheres to RFC 3339.

If a feature has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the
server whether only a single temporal property is used to determine
the extent or all relevant temporal properties.

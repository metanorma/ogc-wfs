|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/link-header +

Links included in payload of responses SHOULD also be included
as `Link` headers in the HTTP response according to <<rfc5988,RFC 5988, Clause 5>>.

This recommendation does not apply, if there are a large number of links
included in a response or a link is not known when the HTTP headers of the
response are created.

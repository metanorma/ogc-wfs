== Scope

This International Standard specifies the behaviour of a server that provides access to features in a dataset in a manner independent of the underlying data store. This standard specifies discovery and query operations.

Discovery operations allow the server to be interrogated to determine its capabilities and retrieve information (metadata) about this distribution of the dataset. This includes the API definition of the server as well as metadata about the feature collections provided by the server.

Query operations allow features to be retrieved from the underlying data store based upon simple selection criteria, defined by the client.

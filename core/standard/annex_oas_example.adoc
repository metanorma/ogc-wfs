== OpenAPI definition example (Informative)

=== Overview

This annex includes two complete examples of an OpenAPI definition for a WFS.

The first example (<<openapi.yaml>>) is a generic example that uses path parameters to describe all
feature collections and all features. This OpenAPI definition does not provide
any details on the collections or the feature content. This information is only
available from the feature collection metadata.

The second example (<<openapi-buildings.yaml>>) does not use a path parameter for
the collections and explicitly provides information about the feature collection
'buildings' (paths `/collections/buildings` etc.), the schema of the building
features (schema `buildingGeoJSON`) and a filter parameter for building features
(parameter `function`).

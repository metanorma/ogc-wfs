For every feature in a feature collection (path `/collections/{name}/items`),
the service SHALL support the HTTP GET operation at the path
`/collections/{name}/items/{id}`.

The parameter `name` is each property of the same name in the feature
collections metadata (JSONPath: `$.collections[*].name`). `id` is a
local identifier of the feature.

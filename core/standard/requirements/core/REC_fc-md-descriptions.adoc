If external schemas or descriptions for the dataset exist that provide
information about the structure or semantics of the data, a `200`-response
SHOULD include links to each of those resources in the `links` property
of the response (relation: `describedBy`).

The `type` link parameter SHOULD be provided for each link.

This applies to resources that describe to the whole dataset. For
resources that describe the contents of a feature collection, the
links SHOULD be set in the `links` property of the appropriate
object in the `collections` resource.

Examples for descriptions are: XML Schema, Schematron, JSON Schema,
RDF Schema, OWL, SHACL, a feature catalogue, etc.
